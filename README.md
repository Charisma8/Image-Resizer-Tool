 Image Resizer Tool - Task 7


A Python script that automatically resizes all images in a folder using Pillow library. Built as part of internship training to learn file handling, image processing, and batch operations.

##  Project Objective
Resize and convert images in batch using Python and Pillow library.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL)- Image processing library
- OS module - File system operations

##  Project Structure

image-resizer/
â”œâ”€â”€ image_resizer.py      # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ input_images/         # Source images folder
â”œâ”€â”€ output_images/        # Processed images folder
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation


##  Features
- Batch resize all images in a folder
- Maintains aspect ratio 
- Supports multiple formats: JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF
- Interactive user prompts
- Progress tracking and file size comparison
- Error handling for unsupported files

##  Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

pip install Pillow


### Run the Script

python image_resizer.py


### Follow Interactive Prompts

Enter input folder: input_images
Enter output folder: output_images
Enter max width: 700
Enter max height: 500

## Output

Enter the path to your input folder (where your images are): input_images
Enter the path to your output folder (where resized images will go): output_images
Enter the maximum width you want (in pixels): 700
Enter the maximum height you want (in pixels): 500
